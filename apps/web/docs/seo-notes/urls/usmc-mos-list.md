# /usmc-mos-list — Optimization Log

## Cycle 2 — 2026-06-16 (Hub SHIPPED — owner overrode the 2026-06-28 gate)

Owner directed shipping the Marines hub immediately rather than waiting for the
2026-06-28 GSC recheck. Built the data-driven hub the same way as Army/Navy:
- **`marinesHub`** added to `src/lib/job-hubs.ts` (`marine-line` scoreSystem,
  `/marines-asvab-calculator` funnel, related links). `JobScoreTable.tsx` +
  `hubScoreStats()` reused unchanged.
- **`/usmc-mos-list` rebuilt IN PLACE** from the 1,360-line hand-coded page into
  the ~430-line data-driven pattern. The old page hand-coded **fabricated MOS
  codes** (0681, 1751, 2611, 2821, 5812, 0111, 6072, 6153, 6174, 6214 — none in
  the dataset), wrong values (0311/0331/0341 GT 80, 0352 GT 80, 2171 as OR, 3043
  CL 90, 0844 GT 100), and a **wrong CL formula** (`WK+PC+MK`, dropping AR). All
  gone — every figure now derives from the audited `marines-jobs.json`.
- Line-score formulas set to ASVAB Hero's own canonical values (site-wide
  consistency): GT=VE+AR, CL=VE+AR+MK, EL=GS+AR+MK+EI, MM=AR+EI+MC+AS,
  ST=GS+VE+MK+MC. Answer-first AEO block, methodology/last-updated note, FAQ +
  FAQPage/Article schema, breadcrumb, related links.

**Verification:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run build` green. Static HTML:
129 MOS rows prerendered (130 `<tr>` incl. header); corrected values present
(CL 105, GT 90, GT 105, MM 85 lowest, EL 115 highest, 2651 "GT 110+ · EL 110+");
fabricated codes + `GT 80` absent.

⏭ Still recheck GSC **2026-06-28** for Army + Navy movement (informs CG/SF/AF
ordering), but Marines is now live regardless.

## Cycle 1 — 2026-06-16 (Jobs-by-score hub program: Marines DATA AUDIT — hub build gated)

Marines is next in the jobs-by-score hub program (`docs/seo-notes/job-hub-build-spec.md`)
after Navy (`navy-ratings-list.md`, shipped) and Army (`army-mos-list.md`, PR #18).
Per the program gate, **the hub build itself does NOT ship until the 2026-06-28 GSC
recheck confirms the Army + Navy hubs are indexing/gaining** (routine
`trig_0155yNviiAtkgDhA3rauWeoC`). But the data audit was done now — a featured
score chart amplifies bad data on an HCU-sensitive site, so each branch dataset
must be clean BEFORE its hub ships, and **the fix also corrects the live
`/marines-asvab-calculator`, which imports the same `marines-jobs.json`.**

### ⚠️ Data integrity audit (the gating finding)
Audited all **129 USMC MOS** in `src/data/marines-jobs.json` against the
operationmilitarykids.org + military.com (Rod Powers) recruiter-facing consensus
(the same canonical standard used for Army), cross-checked vs the Military
Yearbook Project (MCO 1200.17 verbatim) and Marine Corps COOL. Done with 5
parallel research agents (one per occupational-field slice). Reconciled via
`scripts/reconcile-marines-jobs.py` (reference: `scripts/marines-audit-reference.json`).

**The structural smoking gun:** the dataset used only **GT / MM / EL** and *never*
**CL (Clerical)** or **ST (Skilled Technical)** — two of the five USMC composites.
Classic clerical/admin roles were miscoded GT/EL. **8 MOS corrected, 0 removed**
(no phantom codes — every code is a real USMC MOS, unlike Army's fake 14X):

- **Composite miscodings → CL introduced (3):** `3043` Supply Admin `GT 100` →
  **`CL 105`**; `6046` Aircraft Maintenance Admin `EL 100` → **`CL 100`**; `7041`
  Aviation Operations Specialist `GT 100` → **`CL 100`**.
- **Wrong minimums (5):** entry infantry `0311`/`0331`/`0341` `GT 80` → **`GT 90`**;
  `2621` Signals Collection `GT 110` → **`GT 100`**; `7314` UAV Operator `GT 110` →
  **`GT 105`**.
- **ST absence is a VERIFIED finding, not an omission:** every ST-suspect (`5711`
  CBRN, `6842` METOC, `3451` Finance, `1361` Engineer Assistant, `3381` Food
  Service) was confirmed gated on GT/CL, not ST. The USMC gates no MOS in this
  dataset on ST.
- **All 6 AND-pairs confirmed genuine** (left unchanged): `0481` GT95+MM100,
  `1142` MM105+EL100, `2171` MM105+EL115, `2651` GT110+EL110, `6276` MM105+GT110,
  `6694` GT110+EL115. (MCO 1200.17 verbatim corroborated 1142 + 2171.)
- **minAFQT = 32 for all is CORRECT** (unlike Army's per-MOS variance): USMC AFQT
  floor is uniform 32 (diploma) / 50 (GED); the per-MOS gate is the line score.

### Source conflicts adjudicated to the recruiter-facing consensus (documented, not changed)
Where OMK/military.com disagree with MCO-verbatim Military Yearbook Project, the
chart matches the recruiter-facing consensus (Army-audit precedent), all kept:
- 59xx EL **115** (OMK) vs EL 105–110 (MYP/MCO) — `5939`/`5948`/`5974`/`5979`.
- `6276` MM105 **AND** GT110 (OMK + military.com) vs MM105-only (MYP/MCO).
- `0844` GT 105 (OMK fire-control band) vs GT 100 (asvabhero outlier).
- `7257` GT 110 (effective gate via required 7251 trainee) vs GT 105 (its own line).

### Lifecycle flags (real codes in transition — kept, scores verified; revisit at hub build)
`1812` Tank Crewman (USMC divested tanks ~2020-21), `1833` AAV (sunsetting → 1834
ACV), `0317` Scout Sniper (0322 restructure), `6112`/`6152`/`6172` legacy CH-46
titling, `6122` possible T/O removal. All still appear on authoritative tables;
scores correct. Decide presentation before the hub ships.

### Verification
- `scripts/reconcile-marines-jobs.py` → 8 corrections, 0 removed, 129 MOS.
- New composite distribution: GT 60 / MM 42 / EL 30 / **CL 3** (was GT 62 / MM 42
  / EL 31, no CL). Diff surgical: 10 insertions / 10 deletions, shape unchanged.
- JSON valid; `npm run build` green (`/usmc-mos-list` + `/marines-asvab-calculator`
  prerender clean).

### Next (gated)
On/after **2026-06-28**, if the Army + Navy hubs show clean GSC movement, build the
Marines hub: add `marinesHub` to `src/lib/job-hubs.ts` (`marine-line` scoreSystem),
rebuild `/usmc-mos-list` IN PLACE on the data-driven `JobScoreTable` pattern (answer-
first AEO block, line-score composite definitions, methodology/last-updated note,
FAQ + FAQPage schema). Then audit Coast Guard → Space Force → **Air Force last**
(MAGE cutoffs largely non-public). The `JobScoreTable.tsx` + `hubScoreStats()` +
the Navy/Army `armyHub`/`navyHub` configs in `job-hubs.ts` arrive when PR #18 (Army)
merges — rebase this branch on it before building the page.
